# Algorithms-in-Java
These are some useful algorithms that I wrote during an Algorithms class. Could be very useful in the future in Java work.

## Purpose of this repo

The purpose of this repository is to keep some of the regularly used algorithms in the Java langauge. This includes things like...

- Linked Lists
- Double Linked Lists
- Finding longest common strings
- AVL trees, self balancing
and more...

These can be used as a reference if these types of data structures have to be created in the future
